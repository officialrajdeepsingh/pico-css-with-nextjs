                <h6>Hi welcome, </h6>

                <p>
                    I completed my study in master of science in biotechnology last year. After passing out 12 classes, I brought MY first android mobile phone. Then I started using mobile, and I found a video on youtube about how to earn online money. that video changed my life. During my B.sc, I successfully found my first job on the internet. I got selected for a front-end developer role on just theme. My part is to convert png design into HTML and CSS.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After one year, I changed my job. In my second job, I learn many things like reactjs, API, CMS, etc.
                </p>

                    I started my writing career as a technical writer during my job. I published my first book on Linux and a research paper with osf. Some later, I publish one more book on bioinformatics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I publish an article every week on medium and other publications. You can read my article on my medium profile.

                <p>Thank for reading</p>
